\_\_ on reading **Your Life as Art, Robert Fritz**

> Simplicity comes from clarity about what’s important.

- Life is complex when we haven’t defined what is important to us.
- Life is complex when we’ve made too many things important on an equal level.
- Life is complex when nothing in particular is important to us.

> A life is made simple by adopting the principle of value-hierarchy.

Life is very complex when we make everything equal. When things are of the same value, they naturally compete against each other for air time in our life. When we begin to sort out what’s more important and what’s less important, we begin to sort out the complexity.

> There is no place for value conflicts.

Man is pushed by drives. But he is pulled by values. He is always free to accept or to reject a value he is offered by a situation.

> Start making life simple by deciding What’s Really Important.

When we determine the highest position on the hierarchy, the theme in that position organizes our lives, although it is more accurate to say that we organize our life around it.
