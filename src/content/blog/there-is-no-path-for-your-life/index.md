― on reading A Master’s Secret Whispers, **Kapil Gupta**

There is no Path for your life.

The Path is not a Map.  
It is all about **Quality**.

Don’t search for Success  
since success will be followed by Failure,  
and you will search for another success.

Be a seeker of Mastery  
and have the chance to Create Value.

Don’t search for Happiness  
since happiness is the same as the struggle  
and your whole life hopes for sadness to go away.

Be a seeker of Mastery  
and you are right on the path to truly Joy and Experience

Don’t play to win  
He who plays to win suffers the wrath of the mind

Be a seeker of Mastery  
and you are right on the path to play with your Instinct

Sport and Craft are vehicles for perfecting oneself,  
_to truly Play_  
_to closer with Quality_  
_to become Mastery._

Only fool man trains in order to win.  
The wise man devotes his life  
_to sharpen his body_  
_to conquer his mind_  
_and refine his craft_

He trains in order to forge his spirit.  
to perfect himself  
to become Mastery.

**_For his craft is his life_**  
**_and its refinement is his journey,_**  
**_a journey toward perfect himself_**  
**_a journey of  Experience and Mastery._**
