As freeing and empowering as solo travel can be, there are moments when the loneliness hits you like a ton of bricks. No matter how independent or self-assured you might be, there's something about being utterly alone in a foreign place that can shake you to your core.

For me, those waves of loneliness tend to crash in during the quiet moments – when I'm sitting alone in my hostel dorm after an exhilarating day of adventures, or when I'm nursing a glass of wine at a cafe, surrounded by lively groups of friends and families. In those still pockets of solitude, my mind starts to wander, and the doubts start to creep in.

What am I doing here, so far from everything and everyone I know? Is this all really worth it? Don't I have people back home who need me, who are wondering when I'll finally settle down?

The loneliness can be particularly acute during holidays or special occasions when you're used to being surrounded by loved ones. I'll never forget the heart-wrenching pang I felt one Christmas Eve in Hanoi. As I wandered through the city's narrow streets, taking in the twinkling lights and festive decorations, I was overwhelmed by a sense of displacement – like I was an outsider peering in on someone else's warm, joyful traditions.

In those moments, it can be tempting to let the loneliness consume you, to curl up in a ball of self-pity and question every decision that led you to this point. The little voice in your head starts planting seeds of doubt – "You're so selfish for choosing this path." "Your friends and family have all moved on without you." "You'll never find your place in the world if you keep running from it."

But then, just as quickly as those dark clouds roll in, the sun breaks through again with a reminder of why you embarked on this journey in the first place. A friendly local invites you in for a homecooked meal, swapping stories and life wisdom over steaming bowls of pho. Or you strike up a conversation with a fellow solo traveler, and suddenly you're bonding over the shared exhilaration and loneliness that comes with this nomadic life.

In those moments of human connection, no matter how fleeting, the loneliness starts to dissipate. You remember that you're not alone in this – that there's an entire global community of wanderers and seekers who understand the unique push-and-pull of solo travel.

Loneliness, I've come to realize, is simply part of the solo travel experience. It's the yin to the yang of freedom and self-discovery. And like any emotion, it ebbs and flows in cyclical waves. The key is not to resist it or wallow in it, but to let it wash over you, knowing that it will eventually pass.

These days, when those pangs of loneliness start to set in, I've learned to ride them out with patience and self-compassion. I allow myself to feel the sadness and discomfort without judgment, but I also consciously shift my mindset. I make an effort to stay present and soak in the beauty of my surroundings, whether it's the vibrant colors of a local market or the breathtaking sweep of a mountain vista.

I also make sure to nurture my connections back home, scheduling regular video calls with loved ones and sharing my experiences with them in real-time. Their familiar faces and words of encouragement remind me that I'm not alone in this world, even when I'm thousands of miles away.

And perhaps most importantly, I've learned to embrace the loneliness as a catalyst for growth and self-reflection. It's in those quiet moments of solitude that I'm able to turn inward, process my experiences, and gain a deeper understanding of who I am and what I want from this life.

So while the loneliness of solo travel can be daunting at times, I've come to view it as a necessary part of the journey – a reminder that true strength and self-discovery often arise from pushing through discomfort and embracing the unknown. It's a small price to pay for the incredible freedom and perspective that this life has to offer.

Despite being terrified at the prospect of traveling alone as a solo female, I faced my fears and booked a life-changing solo trip to Bali.

Travel has been the greatest teacher, providing invaluable lessons that have profoundly shifted my perspective. From learning to embrace discomfort as a catalyst for growth, to living in the present moment with mindfulness, to keeping an open mind and humility towards different cultures - the road has shaped me into a more resilient, compassionate, and curious human being. These hard-won lessons have been a journey of self-discovery, pushing me beyond my limits and allowing me to evolve in ways my former life could never have offered. They are lessons I'll carry with me as my compass for continued growth.

One of the greatest gifts of travel has been the incredible kindness and generosity I've experienced from strangers around the world. This post recounts some of my most profound and heartwarming encounters - from a student giving me a guided tour in Vietnam to a Nepali family taking me into their home, and many others. These special human connections have renewed my faith in our shared humanity and the goodness in people.
