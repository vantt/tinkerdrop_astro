Adrew Stanton, tác giả và đạo diễn của loạt phim hoạt hình nổi tiếng WALL-E, Finding Nemo và A Bug’s Life  đã chia sẽ cho chúng ta một câu truyện thú vị

In 1998, I had finished writing “Toy Story” and “A Bug’s Life” and I was completely hooked on screenwriting. So I wanted to become much better at it and learn anything I could. So I researched everything I possibly could. And I finally came across this fantastic quote by a British playwright, William Archer: “Drama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty.” It’s an incredibly insightful definition.

When you’re telling a story, have you constructed anticipation? In the short-term, have you made me want to know what will happen next? But more importantly, have you made me want to know how it will all conclude in the long-term? Have you constructed honest conflicts with truth that creates doubt in what the outcome might be? An example would be in “Finding Nemo,” in the short tension, you were always worried, would Dory’s short-term memory make her forget whatever she was being told by Marlin. But under that was this global tension of will we ever find Nemo in this huge, vast ocean?
