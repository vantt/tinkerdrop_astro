Murphy’s Law states, “Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.” !

Problems seem to arise naturally on their own, while solutions always require our attention, energy, and effort.2!

This force is so fundamental to the way our world works that it permeates nearly every endeavor we pursue. It drives many of the problems we face and leads to disarray. It is the one force that governs everybody’s life: Entropy.2!

Imagine that you take a box of puzzle pieces and dump them out on a table. In theory, it is possible for the pieces to fall perfectly into place and create a completed puzzle when you dump them out of the box. But in reality, that never happens.3!

Entropy is a measure of disorder. And there are always far more disorderly variations than orderly ones.5!

it always increases over time.2!

It is the natural tendency of things to lose order. Left to its own devices, life will always become less structured.3!

With enough time, even mountains erode and their precise edges become rounded. The inevitable trend is that things become less organized.2!

This is known as the Second Law of Thermodynamics. It is one of the foundational concepts of chemistry and it is one of the fundamental laws of our universe. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the entropy of a closed system will never decrease.3!

Without Effort, Life Tends to Lose Order3!

You can fight back against the pull of entropy. You can solve a scattered puzzle. You can pull the weeds out of your garden. You can clean a messy room. You can organize individuals into a cohesive team.3!

because the universe naturally slides toward disorder, you have to expend energy to create stability, structure, and simplicity. Successful relationships require care and attention.2!

Without effort, things will decay.4!

This insight—that disorder has a natural tendency to increase over time and that we can counteract that tendency by expending energy—reveals the core purpose of life. We must exert effort to create useful types of order that are resilient enough to withstand the unrelenting pull of entropy.4!

“The ultimate purpose of life, mind, and human striving: to deploy energy and information to fight back the tide of entropy and carve out refuges of beneficial order.” —Steven Pinker5!

“The hardest thing in the world is to simplify your life because everything is pulling you to be more and more complex.”3!

Entropy will always increase on its own. The only way to make things orderly again is to add energy. Order requires effort.4!

Why Life is Remarkable Consider the human body. The collection of atoms that make up your body could be arranged in a virtually infinite number of ways and nearly all of them lead to no form of life whatsoever. Mathematically speaking, the odds are overwhelmingly against your very presence. You are a very unlikely combination of atoms. And yet, here you are. It is truly remarkable.1!

Artists create a form of order and symmetry that, odds are, the universe would never generate on its own. It is so rare in the grand scheme of possibilities.1!

There are many ways a marriage can fail—financial stress, parenting issues, crazy in-laws, conflicts in core values, lack of trust, infidelity, and so on. A deficiency in any one of these areas can wreck a family. To be happy, however, you need some degree of success in each major area. Thus, all happy families are alike because they all have a similar structure. Disorder can occur in many ways, but order, in only a few.1!

Why Optimal Lives Are Designed Not Discovered You have a combination of talents, skills, and interests that are specific to you. But you also live in a larger society and culture that were not designed with your specific abilities in mind. Given what we know about entropy, what do you think the odds are that the environment you happen to grow up in is also the optimal environment for your talents? It is very unlikely that life is going to present you with a situation that perfectly matches your strengths. Out of all the possible scenarios you could encounter, it’s far more likely that you’ll encounter one that does not cater to your talents.1!

Evolutionary biologists use a term called “mismatch conditions” to describe when an organism is not well-suited for a condition it is facing.3!

Obviously, when you are in a mismatch condition, it is more difficult to succeed, to be useful, and to win.2!

Knowing this, you must take it upon yourself to design your ideal lifestyle. You have to turn a mismatch condition into a well-matched one. Optimal lives are designed, not discovered.3!

It is nobody’s fault that life has problems. It is simply a law of probability. There are many disordered states and few ordered ones. Given the odds against us, what is remarkable is not that life has problems, but that we can solve them at all.3!

unless you add outside energy to keep things orderly, the natural trend of any closed system is to become more disordered.2!

“The Second Law defines the ultimate purpose of life, mind, and human striving: to deploy energy and information to fight back the tide of entropy and carve out refuges of beneficial order.”2!

this is how the first forms of life arose. As the sun beat down on the earth it provided the additional energy necessary for molecules to form into structures that could resist the chaos of entropy. The extra energy helped the first forms of life maintain order.2!

There is a related insight here. You should probably quit things faster than you do. There is always a risk that you will quit too early, but of all the possible things you could be exposed to and invested in, it is very unlikely that you are currently engaged in the best thing for you. Thus, if results are not coming easily, move on.2!

——————————

The second law of thermodynamics states that “as one goes forward in time, the net entropy (degree of disorder) of an isolated or closed system will always increase (or at least stay the same).”1!

Entropy is simply a measure of disorder. You can think of it as nature’s tax\[2\].1!

we can define entropy as a measure of the disorder of the universe1!

“The increase of disorder or entropy is what distinguishes the past from the future, giving a direction to time.” — Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time2!

Entropy is fundamentally a probabilistic idea: For every possible “usefully ordered” state of molecules, there are many, many more possible “disordered” states. Just as energy tends towards a less useful, more disordered state, so do businesses and organizations in general. Rearranging the molecules — or business systems and people — into an “ordered” state requires an injection of outside energy.2!

It reminds one distinctly of entropy: For every useful arrangement of affairs towards a common business goal, there are many orders of magnitude more arrangements that will get us nowhere.1!

Given a strong enough goal, a good enough team, and the right incentives, perhaps that group wouldn’t need a lot “outside ordering” — they would manage themselves.1!

“The … ultimate purpose of life, mind, and human striving: to deploy energy and information to fight back the tide of entropy and carve out refuges of beneficial order.”2!

Without constant maintenance from individuals and dominant institutions, societies tend towards chaos. Divergent behavior escalates — a concept known as the “broken windows” theory.1!

However, the line between controlling entropy and suppressing people’s liberty is a thin one. Excessive control can lead to a situation akin to Foucault’s panopticon, wherein people are under constant surveillance, lack freedom of speech and movement, are denied other rights as well, and are subject to overzealous law enforcement. This approach is counterproductive and leads to eventual rebellion once a critical mass of dissenters forms.2!

“Everything that comes together falls apart. Everything. The chair I’m sitting on. It was built, and so it will fall apart. I’m going to fall apart, probably before this chair. And you’re going to fall apart. The cells and organs and systems that make you you—they came together, grew together, and so must fall apart. The Buddha knew one thing science didn’t prove for millennia after his death: Entropy increases. Things fall apart.” — John Green, Looking for Alaska2!

Disorder is not a mistake; it is our default. Order is always artificial and temporary.1!

The question is not whether we can prevent entropy (we can’t), but how we can curb, control, work with, and understand it.1!

Because things naturally move to disorder over time, we can position ourselves to create stability. There are two types of stability: active and passive. Consider a ship, which, if designed well, should be able to sail through a storm without intervention. This is passive stability. A fighter jet, in contrast, requires active stability. The plane can’t fly for more than a few seconds without having to adjust its wings. This adjustment happens so fast that it’s controlled by software. There is no inherent stability here: if you cut the power, the plane crashes.\[3\]1!

Relationships, for example, require attention and care. If you assume that your relationship is passively stable, you’ll wake up one day to divorce papers.1!

You’re applying energy to get something done. The higher the entropy in the system, the less efficient the energy you apply will be.1!

In essence, for a change to occur, you must apply more energy to the system than is extracted by the system.2!
